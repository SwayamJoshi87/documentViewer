This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Adding a database to the app

The app is designed to be deployed on a platfrom like vercel. All the setup will be already done for you in the code. 

- Login to your vercel or vercel/like platform and go to integrations. 
- Find postgreSQL/Neon DB. This will give you one free database.
- Here, go to run query and copy the databaseINIT query( Currently work in progrss ).
- This is automatically provide the connection url and necessary info to the vercel app with a .env file.
- Redeploy the vercel app which will result in the database being added to the vercel app.
